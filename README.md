# Generic-Parllel-Prefix-using-OpenMP

                                                Objective

Task is to implement efficient C++/OpenMP parallel prefix function omp_scan. We make two assumptions: first, the number of input elements is much larger than the number of available processors, second, the number of available processors is relatively small.

                                                Description

Arguments of the omp_scan are as follows:

T : type of the elements on which prefix will be applied.

Op : type representing a binary associative operator compatible with T.

n : number of input elements.

in : pointer to the array of size n storing input items.

out : pointer to the output array of size n to store output prefix.

op : object representing associative operator of type Op. Just in case, invocation like out[1] = op(in[0], in[1]); applies the operator to items in[0] and in[1] and stores the result in out[1].
